#### Refactor
- **ai-tracker.sh**:
    - Stored the current date in a `CURRENT_DATE` variable to avoid redundant `date` command calls.
    - Updated the script to use the new `CURRENT_DATE` variable for consistency.

### Refactor
- **GEMINI.md**:
    - Updated virtual environment instruction to use `.venv`.
    - Replaced WIP commit instruction with a directive to think step-by-step and seek confirmation before proceeding.

### What's New
#### `server.py`
- Implemented a complete web server using Python's `http.server` to host a frontend and handle API requests for file uploads and chat queries.
#### `frontend/`
- Added a full user interface (`index.html`, `script.js`, `style.css`) for the chat application, including features for file drag-and-drop, a chat window, and file selection.
#### `hierarchical_late_chunking.py`
- Replaced the static script with an interactive command-line loop, allowing users to ask multiple questions.
- Implemented a check to see if a document already exists in the vector database, prompting the user before re-ingesting.
#### `components/llm/gemini_llm.py`
- Introduced a new `GeminiLLM` class, providing a dedicated client to interact with the Google Gemini API for generation, summarization, and query expansion.
#### `components/llm/jina_llm.py`
- Created a new synchronous `JinaLLM` client using the `requests` library to interact with all Jina AI API services.
#### `components/models/llm_model.py`
- Defined a comprehensive set of Pydantic models to ensure structured and validated data for all API inputs and outputs.
#### `ai-tracker.sh`
- Added a new shell script to automate the process of generating project updates, writing to `UPDATES.md`, and creating git commits.
#### `components/chroma_db.py`
- Added a `delete_collection` method to the `ChromaDb` class.
### Refactor
#### `components/embeddings_llm/jina_embedding_model.py`
- Overhauled the Jina embedding model to inherit from the new `JinaLLM` client, replacing the direct dependency on the `jina` package with synchronous `requests` calls.
#### `components/dummy_llm.py`
- Updated the `DummyLLM` to return Pydantic models (`SummarizeOutput`, `AnswerOutput`, etc.) instead of primitive types, aligning it with the new structured data flow.
#### `components/hierarchy_late_chunk.py`
- Modified the ingestion process to handle `.txt` files directly, improving efficiency.
- Adapted the pipeline to use the new Pydantic data models returned by the LLM and embedding components.
#### `components/embeddings_llm/llm_interface.py`
- Updated the `LLMInterface` protocol to reflect the new method signatures that return Pydantic models.
#### `components/embeddings_llm/BaseEmbeddingClass.py`
- Created a new base class to standardize the structure of embedding model implementations.
### Bugfix
#### `components/hierarchy_late_chunk.py`
- Fixed a bug in the ChromaDB query by correcting the `where` filter to use the proper `$and` operator for metadata filtering.
### Dependencies
#### `pyproject.toml` & `uv.lock`
- Removed the `jina` package and its extensive tree of dependencies (including `fastapi`, `aiohttp`, `uvicorn`, `opentelemetry`).
- Added `requests` and `multipart` as new, lightweight dependencies for handling HTTP requests and form data.
### Tests
#### `tests/components/test_hierarchy_late_chunk.py`
- Massively expanded test coverage by adding a full end-to-end integration test class (`TestHierarchyLateChunkIntegration`).
- The new tests cover the entire ingestion and query pipeline for Markdown, TXT, and PDF files.
#### `tests/components/test_jina_embedding_model.py`
- Added new live integration tests for the `JinaEmbeddingModel` to verify API connectivity and functionality.
#### `tests/components/test_files/test_pdf.pdf`
- Added a sample PDF file to be used in testing.
### Documentation
#### `README.md`
- Created a comprehensive `README.md` with detailed explanations of the project's core concepts, architecture, setup, and usage.
#### `PLANNING.md`
- Added a new `PLANNING.md` file containing a detailed project plan, architecture overview, and a Mermaid diagram illustrating the data flow.
#### `AI_TRACKER_GENIE.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `TASK.md`
- Added several new markdown files to document AI assistant instructions, project tasks, and the `ai-tracker` tool.
#### `GEMINI.md`
- Overhauled the `GEMINI.md` file with a completely new and more detailed set of instructions for the AI assistant.
### Build
#### `.gitignore`
- Updated the `.gitignore` file to exclude `__pycache__` directories, `.csv` files, dotfiles, and `.egg-info` build artifacts.
#### `pyproject.toml`
- Configured `setuptools` for automatic package discovery and set the `pythonpath` for `pytest` to simplify test execution.
